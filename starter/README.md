# React Boilerplate

This is a small boilerplate for building
[React](http://facebook.github.io/react/) apps with
[Babel](https://babeljs.io/) and [webpack](https://webpack.github.io/).

## Installation

You need node.js installed.

* Run `npm install` from inside this folder to install the dependencies.
* Run `npm run watch` to build the JavaScript.
* Open `index.html` in your browser to see your code.

## Developing

The entry file for your app is in `app/js/app.js`, so start editing there.
Running `npm run watch` will run webpack and rebuild your app whenever the
JavaScript changes. Babel means you can use fancy ES2015 goodness. Go forth and
build neat things!
